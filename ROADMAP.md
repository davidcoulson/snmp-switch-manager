## 📝 Planned

### 📶 Bandwidth Sensors  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-bandwidth-sensors`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-bandwidth-sensors)

Add real-time and cumulative traffic visibility for every network interface.

#### Planned Capabilities
- ⬆️ **Total Transmit (TX) Bandwidth**  
  - Cumulative bytes sent per interface  
- ⬇️ **Total Receive (RX) Bandwidth**  
  - Cumulative bytes received per interface  
- ⚡ **Live Throughput (bps)**  
  - Real-time transmit and receive speeds in bits per second  

#### Design Goals
- ✅ Works across **all supported platforms**
  - Cisco SG / CBS  
  - Arista  
  - Juniper (EX series)  
  - OPNsense / pfSense  
- ✅ Uses **high-capacity 64-bit counters** where available (`ifHCInOctets`, `ifHCOutOctets`)
- ✅ **Automatic 32-bit counter wrap detection & correction**
- ✅ **Efficient polling** via the existing coordinator (no per-entity SNMP sessions)
- ✅ **Minimal Home Assistant performance impact**
- ✅ Default exposure as **per-port attributes**
- ✅ Optional exposure as **dedicated diagnostic sensors**

### 🌡️ Switch Environmentals & CPU / Memory Usage  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-switch-environmentals`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-switch-environmentals)

Add environmental monitoring and system performance telemetry for supported switches and routers.

#### Planned Capabilities
- 🌡️ **Temperature Monitoring**  
  - CPU, PSU, and chassis temperature sensors (when available via SNMP)  
- 🧠 **CPU Utilization**  
  - Current system CPU usage percentage  
- 💾 **Memory Utilization**  
  - Current system memory usage percentage  

#### Design Goals
- ✅ Works across **all supported platforms**
  - Cisco SG / CBS  
  - Arista  
  - Juniper (EX series)  
  - OPNsense / pfSense  
- ✅ Uses **standard SNMP environmental and performance OIDs**
- ✅ **Automatic unit handling**
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit conversion where applicable  
- ✅ **Efficient polling** via the existing coordinator
- ✅ **Minimal Home Assistant performance impact**
- ✅ Default exposure as **dedicated sensor entities**

#### Immediate Capabilities Enabled by This Feature
- 📈 **Historical temperature and utilization graphs** (via Home Assistant statistics)
- 🚨 **Temperature & performance alerting** via automations
- 📊 **Live environmental and system load display** in the Switch Manager UI

### ⚡ Power over Ethernet (PoE) Statistics  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-poe-statistics`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-poe-statistics)

Add real-time **PoE power usage, status, and budget monitoring** for supported PoE-capable switches.

#### Planned Capabilities
- ⚡ **Per-Port Power Usage (Watts)**  
  - Real-time PoE draw per interface  
- 🔌 **Per-Port PoE Status**  
  - Enabled / Disabled / Fault state  
- 🧮 **Total PoE Budget Usage**  
  - Overall switch PoE utilization percentage  
- 📊 **Available vs Used Power Budget**  
  - Remaining PoE headroom for new devices  

#### Design Goals
- ✅ Uses **standard and vendor-specific PoE SNMP OIDs**
  - Cisco  
  - Arista  
  - Juniper  
  - MikroTik (where supported)  
- ✅ **Automatic unit normalization** (W, mW, percentage)
- ✅ **Efficient polling** via the existing coordinator
- ✅ **Minimal Home Assistant performance impact**
- ✅ Default exposure as:
  - 📎 **Attributes on port switch entities**, and/or  
  - ⚙️ **Dedicated diagnostic sensor entities**

#### Immediate Capabilities Enabled by This Feature
- 🚨 **PoE overload and fault alerting**
- 📈 **Historical PoE power usage graphs**
- 🔍 **Fast detection of non-responsive powered devices**
- 📊 **Live PoE power display** in the Switch Manager UI
