## Highlights

- 🔍 Automatic discovery of port count, speed, VLAN ID (PVID), description, and operational status via SNMP v2c
- 🔄 Background polling that keeps Home Assistant entities in sync with switch updates
- 🎚️ One `switch` entity per interface for toggling administrative state (up/down)
- 🏷️ Service for updating the interface alias (`ifAlias`) without leaving Home Assistant
- 🖼️ Lovelace card that mirrors the switch layout with colour-coded port status and quick actions

---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.11.2 or newer (recommended)
- A switch reachable via SNMP v2c (UDP/161) with read access to interface tables and write access to `ifAlias`
- The SNMP community string that grants the required permissions
- pysnmp 7.x (the integration installs it automatically when needed)

---

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
You can install this integration directly from HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=OtisPresley&repository=snmp-switch-manager)

After installation, restart Home Assistant and add the integration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=snmp_switch_manager)

---

#### Manual steps (if you prefer not to use the buttons)
1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS → Integrations**.  
2. Click **Explore & Download Repositories**, search for **SNMP Switch Manager**, then click **Download**.  
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.  
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → SNMP Switch Manager**.  

### Manual install
1. Copy the folder `custom_components/snmp_switch_manager` into your HA `config/custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → SNMP Switch Manager**.

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** and search for **SNMP Switch Manager**.
2. Enter the switch hostname/IP address, the SNMP community string, and optionally a friendly name or non-standard SNMP port.
3. Once the flow completes, Home Assistant adds one `switch` entity per discovered interface. Entities follow the pattern `switch.<hostname>_<interface_name>` (for example: `switch.switch1_gi1_0_1`).

### Custom SNMP OIDs (Advanced)

Per-device custom SNMP OIDs can be configured from the integration options (⚙️ icon).

This allows overriding how the following diagnostic sensors are detected:
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Firmware
- Hostname
- Uptime

Notes:
- Overrides apply **only to the selected device**
- Leave a field blank to fall back to automatic detection
- A reset option is available to restore defaults
- Useful for devices with vendor-specific or non-standard SNMP implementations

## Lovelace card

### HACS (recommended)

You can install this card directly from HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=OtisPresley&repository=snmp-switch-manager-card)

🚫 **No manual resource configuration is required.**

This card includes its editor automatically, so you do **not** need to add any additional JavaScript resources under  
**Settings → Dashboards → Resources**.

After installation, restart Home Assistant. The card will then be available as:

**Custom: SNMP Switch Manager Card**

---

### 🔁 Migrating from Manual to HACS Installation (Important)

If you previously installed this card manually using resource URLs, follow these steps to safely migrate to the HACS-managed version:

1. 🗑️ **Remove old resources** from  
   **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**
   - Remove:
     ```
     /local/community/snmp-switch-manager-card/snmp-switch-manager-card.js
     ```
     ```
     /local/community/snmp-switch-manager-card/snmp-switch-manager-card-editor.js
     ```

2. 📂 **Delete the old manually installed files** from: `/config/www/community/snmp-switch-manager-card/`
3. ✅ **Install the card via HACS** using the HACS button above.

4. 🔄 **Restart Home Assistant**

Once complete, everything will be fully managed by HACS and you will continue to receive automatic updates.

---

### Manual installation

1. Download the `snmp-switch-manager-card.js` file from the [SNMP Switch Manager Card repository](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager-card/tree/main/dist) and place it in Home Assistant here:
`/config/www/community/snmp-switch-manager-card/`

2. Add **only one** JavaScript resource under  
**Settings → Dashboards → Resources**:

   ```yaml
   url: /local/community/snmp-switch-manager-card/snmp-switch-manager-card.js
   type: module
   ```
   ⚠️ Do NOT add a separate editor resource. The editor is embedded in the card.
   
---

## Configuration

1. Place the card on any dashboard and edit via the GUI or in YAML:

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otispresley/snmp-switch-manager/main/assets/screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot 1" width="250"/>
   </p>

   ```yaml
   type: custom:snmp-switch-manager-card
   title: Core Switch
   view: panel
   ports_per_row: 24
   info_position: below
   label_size: 6
   anchor_entity: switch.gi1_0_1
   port_size: 18
   gap: 10
   
   # Optional display controls
   hide_diagnostics: false
   hide_virtual_interfaces: false
   
   # Optional panel background image (panel view only)
   background_image: /local/switches/core-switch.png
   ports_offset_x: 0
   ports_offset_y: 0
   ports_scale: 1
   
   # Optional per-port positioning overrides
   port_positions:
     Gi1/0/1: { x: 120, y: 80 }
     Gi1/0/2: { x: 150, y: 80 }
   ```

   The follows are descriptions of the settings:
   - `title` sets the text displayed at the tip of the card.
   - `view` sets the style that the card uses. `list` lists each port in a tile. `panel` show a representation of the front of a switch.
   - `ports_per_row` sets the number of ports to show in each row on the card when in panel view.
   - `panel width` The total width of the card in pixels when in panel view.
   - `info_position` displays the Diagnostics and Virtual Interfaces either `above` the phisical ports or `below` them.
   - `label_size` determines the font size used for the port labels when in panel view.
   - `anchor_entity` is any entity in your switch so it knows which ports and diagnostics to display.
   - `diagnostics` is a list of sensors you want to display in the diagnostics area.
   - `port_size` determines the size of the port images when in panel view.
   - `gap` determines how far apart the ports are when in panel view.
   - `hide_diagnostics` hides the Diagnostics panel entirely when set to `true`.
   - `hide_virtual_interfaces` hides the Virtual Interfaces panel entirely when set to `true`.
   - `background_image` sets a custom switch image for panel view.
   - `ports_offset_x` and `ports_offset_y` move all ports to align with the background image.
   - `ports_scale` scales all ports uniformly.
   - `port_positions` allows individual ports to be positioned manually.
      
   Clicking a port opens a unified information dialog (used in both panel and list views) showing:

   - Interface name
   - Admin and Oper status
   - Speed
   - VLAN ID
   - Interface index
   
   From this dialog you can also edit the port description when supported.

## Services

### Update a port description

Use the `snmp_switch_manager.set_port_description` service to change an interface alias:

```yaml
service: snmp_switch_manager.set_port_description
data:
  entity_id: switch.gi1_0_5
  description: Uplink to router
```

---

### Toggle administrative state

The state of each port entity reflects the interface's administrative status. Turning it **on** sets the port to *up*; turning it **off** sets it to *down*. Entity attributes include both administrative and operational status direct from SNMP. Entity attributes include administrative status, operational status, port speed, VLAN ID (PVID), and IP configuration when available.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Ports missing:** Ensure the SNMP community string permits reads on the interface tables (`ifDescr`, `ifSpeed`, `ifOperStatus`).
- **Description updates fail:** Confirm the community string has write permission for `ifAlias` (`1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18`).
- **Unexpected speeds:** Some devices report zero or vendor-specific rates for unused interfaces; check the switch UI to confirm raw SNMP data.

---

## Support

If your switch does not display correctly, then the integration will need to have specific support added for it. Please open an issue with an text file attachment with the results of an `snmpwalk` command against your switch with an **RW SNMP v2c community string** and any necessary screenshots. Also describe what is incorrect and what it should look like.
