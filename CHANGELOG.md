## [0.6.8] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- 📊 **Bandwidth Attributes Mode (`features/bandwidth.py`)**: Fixed an issue where interface entities did not expose RX/TX throughput and total attributes when configured in `attributes` mode because `bw_enabled` and `bw_mode` were not set in the coordinator cache. In addition, clearing stale bandwidth data when bandwidth polling is disabled and defaulting `CONF_BW_MODE` to `BW_MODE_SENSORS` ensures reliable mode handling ([#101](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/101)).
- 🌡️ **Temperature Polling `invalid_values` & Range Validation (`features/temperature.py`)**: Added support for filtering raw sensor sentinel values specified in `invalid_values` (such as `65535` for disconnected H3C sensors) and added strict `[-20.0, 100.0]` °C temperature range validation (with support for item-specific range overrides) across both table walk and single GET polling paths ([#102](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/102)).
- 🔄 **Database Updater Missing Topology Files (`db_updater.py`)**: Updated the automatic database updater to include topology files (`arp.json`, `base_mac.json`, `fdb.json`, `lldp.json`) and dynamically discover any JSON database files present in the `database/` directory, ensuring all current and future definitions receive upstream updates ([#103](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/103)).

## [0.6.7] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed
- ⚡ **GETBULK Timeout Fallback (`snmp_compat.py`)**: Fixed an issue where switches whose firmware silently drops SNMPv2c `GetBulkRequest` packets (such as Realtek-based models like the Intellinet 560559 V3) would encounter repeated request timeouts and fail to initialize. The table walk engine now catches non-auth timeouts, remembers that bulk requests are unsupported on the agent, and seamlessly falls back to standard GETNEXT walks. Also added single-OID fallback for chunked GET requests ([#100](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/100)).
- 🐛 **`ifConnectorPresent` OID Typo**: Corrected `OID_ifConnectorPresent` in `const.py` from `1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10` (`ifHCOutOctets`) to the standard RFC 2863 OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.17`. Restores accurate connector presence detection for physical switch ports ([#98](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/98)). Thanks to @hf7a!
- 🕒 **Database Updater Startup & Network Resilience**: Deferred the initial database update check from 10s to 60s after Home Assistant startup to allow network and DNS services to settle, added request timeouts (15s total, 5s connect), and converted transient offline/timeout errors to warnings.

### Added
- 🎛️ **Intellinet Vendor Detection & Private PoE MIB Support**: Added enterprise OID mapping for Intellinet Network Solutions (`45855` / `1.3.6.1.4.1.45855`) to `vendors.json` and support for Intellinet private per-port PoE power reporting (`1.3.6.1.4.1.54367.1.2.2.4.4.1.3`) to `poe.json` ([#99](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/99)). Thanks to @jamesleroy03!

## [0.6.6] - 2026-09-19

### Improved
- ⚡ **GETBULK Table Walking (`_do_bulk_walk` & `_async_walk_many`)**: Replaced one-row-at-a-time GETNEXT walks with multi-row, multi-column GETBULK requests for interface tables, entity sensors, and storage metrics. Features adaptive budget halving for agents returning `tooBig`/`genErr`, seamless GETNEXT fallback from the current cursor for agents lacking GETBULK support, and protection against subtree bleeding and non-advancing loops. System info (`sysDescr`, `sysName`, `sysContact`, `sysLocation`) is now batched with `sysUpTime` (every 5 min) in a single request instead of five individual GETs every 10 seconds. Dramatically reduces SNMP round-trips (e.g. 756 to 13 requests on 188-port switches) and Home Assistant event loop CPU decoding load ([#96](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/pull/96)). Huge thanks to @davidcoulson!
- ⏱️ **Staggered Multi-Switch Polling (`stagger.py`)**: Evenly distributes coordinator poll schedules across the update interval when multiple switches are configured, preventing them from synchronizing their SNMP queries in the same second at startup. Eliminates multi-switch event loop decoding stalls ([#97](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/pull/97)). Huge thanks to @davidcoulson!

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- ⚡ **Card DOM Thrashing & Async Concurrency Lock**: Added animation-frame debouncing and an async concurrency render lock with a trailing execution queue to `snmp-switch-manager-card` (`frontend-card/src/card.js`). Resolves severe DOM thrashing, high browser CPU usage, and UI stuttering caused by rapid Home Assistant state updates ([#95](https://github.com/OtisPresley/snmp-switch-manager/issues/95)). Thanks to @hf7a!

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- 🌐 **Polish Language Translation Support**: Added full Polish (`pl`) translation and strings files across all configuration and options flow steps in both `strings/` and `translations/` directories. Thanks to @hf7a!

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- 🌐 **Chinese Language Translation Support**: Added full Chinese (Simplified `zh-Hans`, Traditional `zh-Hant`, and generic `zh`) translation and strings files across all configuration and options flow steps in both `strings/` and `translations/` directories.
- 🗺️ **Topology OID Overrides**: Added options flow forms and database schemas for custom LLDP, FDB, ARP, and Base MAC OID overrides.
- 🌐 **Localized Feature Strings & Translations**: Updated descriptions and options flow strings for new OID overrides across all supported languages (DE, EN, ES, FR, IT, NL, ZH) in `strings/` and `translations/` directories.

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- 🎛️ **Memory Usage Percentage OID Override**: Added a new optional "Memory Usage Percentage OID" field to the memory override form. The polling backend now supports single-percentage memory OID overrides, translating the value into virtual total/free memory sizes to maintain compatibility with existing sensors.
- 🌐 **Localized Memory Percentage Override Strings**: Added translation strings and updated descriptions for the new memory OID fields and errors across all supported languages (DE, EN, ES, FR, IT, NL) in both `strings/` and `translations/` directories.

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Legacy PySNMP Fallback Compatibility**: Corrected import and function wrappers in the legacy PySNMP/PySNMP-lextudio compatibility fallback layer (`snmp_compat.py`), resolving a startup initialization crash (`ImportError`) when falling back to legacy PySNMP libraries.
- ⚡ **PoE Polling GET Method Support**: Enabled GET-method queries for PoE budget and used power OIDs (in addition to standard WALK subtrees), correcting an issue where scalar PoE usage OIDs returned 'Unknown'.
- 🛡️ **Conditional Duplicate OID Checks**: Restructured duplicate OID checks to run only when the user chooses to share the OID with the community (`share_with_community: true`). This resolves an issue where users were blocked from overriding scale or parameters for OIDs already in the built-in database.
- 🎛️ **Consistent Form Pre-population**: Fixed options flow form pre-population defaults to resolve OIDs matching the device's active vendor (or Standard fallback) instead of picking the first database entry. Restored pre-populating scale factor values for memory, fans, temperature, power, and PoE override forms.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- 📦 **Embedded Lovelace Companion Card**: Bundled the `snmp-switch-manager-card` directly inside the integration repo, serving it on startup and automatically registering it as a Lovelace resource (for storage dashboards).
- 🛠️ **Card Build Toolchain Integration**: Moved the card's source code and compilation scripts under `frontend-card/` in the integration repository, making it straightforward to edit and rebuild the card bundle locally.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

* 🔌 **Connection Loss & Graceful Offline Handling:** Integrated robust exception raising (`SnmpConnectionError`), startup retry lifecycle (`ConfigEntryNotReady`), runtime polling failure (`UpdateFailed`), and self-healing persistent notifications with custom offline switch imagery.
* 🎛️ **100% Modular, Database-Driven Interface Filters:** Migrated all built-in vendor interface filter rules (Cisco SG, Junos, pfSense, CPU pseudo-interfaces) from hardcoded Python code into the dynamic `interface_filters.json` database. A fully vendor-agnostic match engine dynamically interprets these filters based on interface names, state, and IP configurations, enabling seamless community-driven filter contributions and automatic updates without code changes.
* 🔌 **Dynamic Port Classification Schema:** Shifted absolute standard MIB type virtual indicators into `interface_classification.json` under `"virtual_iftypes"`, enabling dynamic customization of hardware port classification rules.
* 🕒 **Scheduled Background Database Auto-Updater:** Automates downloading of system OIDs, filters, and classifications for all **12 database files** from the main repository branch every 6 hours. Performs structural JSON validation and immediately applies updates to running switch/sensor entities within 2 seconds without an HA restart.
* 🔌 **Power over Ethernet (PoE) Control Loops & overrides:** Introduced admin-control toggles for PoE power allocation per physical interface using standard MIB structures. Added full support for custom PoE OID overrides (`Admin state OID` and `Power priority OID`) via the Options Flow forms and database overrides inside `poe.json`.
* 📏 **Dynamic Telemetry Scaling Factors:** Enabled fully custom numeric multipliers (e.g., `0.1` or `1.0`) across all hardware sensors (CPU, Memory, PSU, Fans, PoE, Temp) dynamically from the Home Assistant options flow overrides.
* 🎛️ **Advanced Feature & System OID Overrides:** A brand new, beautifully structured overrides panel under **Device Options**. You can now override custom OIDs for CPU, Memory, Temperature, Fans, PSUs, PoE, and Device Diagnostics (including `Contact`, `Name`, and `Location` OIDs cached inside `device_info.json`) with built-in validation.
* ⚡ **GitHub Community Submissions:** Submit your verified custom OID overrides directly to the public repository from the Home Assistant UI via simple GitHub device authentication to help others.
* 🛠️ **System Mutation & Port Control Services:** Added new administrative control services to manage switch parameters directly from Home Assistant:
  * `set_port_admin_status`: Set standard interface admin status (Up/Down) via target switches.
  * `set_poe_port_admin`: Set PoE port admin status (Auto/Off) on PoE switches.
  * `set_poe_port_priority`: Set PoE power priority allocation (Critical/High/Low) on PoE select entities.
  * `set_system_name`, `set_system_contact`, and `set_system_location`: Modify SNMP system identifiers dynamically, fully integrated with custom OID overrides.
* 🛡️ **Community PR Attestation Pipelines:** Added three Attestation Checkbox confirmations requiring users to verify their filters/tokens are generic, tested, and beneficial to all users before submitting to the repository.
* 📦 **Modular Refactored Settings:** The options flow is now fully split into responsive submenus (Interfaces, Bandwidth, Environmentals, Connection & Name, and Feature Overrides) for an incredibly fast and clean configuration experience.
* 🌐 **Perfect Translation Sync:** Localized all new community filter, classification token options flows, custom PoE overrides, and system OID override settings across **German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Dutch** inside both `strings/` and `translations/` subdirectories.
* 🔌 **Standard MIB-Based Interface Classification:** Integrated parallel polling of standard MIB-II `ifConnectorPresent` (`1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10`) TruthValues to automatically and accurately classify physical (RJ45/SFP) hardware ports vs virtual interfaces (VLANs, Tunnels, Loopbacks, LAGs), with immediate, robust fallback to rule-matching and database classifications when legacy hardware is encountered.

### Fixed

* 🔌 **Dynamic Port Speed Telemetry:** Resolved a bug where switch port physical link speed attributes and sensors were only walked once at startup, causing their values to remain frozen at the initial speed when physical link renegotiation occurred (e.g. toggling from 1 Gbps to 100 Mbps). Moved physical link speed polling (`ifSpeed` and `ifHighSpeed`) to the dynamic/always-polled telemetry loop and added automatic stale value pruning to dynamically update interface speed attributes and sensors in real-time.
* 📈 **Throughput Sensor Negative Values on Switch Reboot:** Resolved an issue where 64-bit High Capacity (HC) counters yielded negative throughput rates following a switch reboot or counter reset. The bandwidth polling loop now gracefully returns `None` for rates when a negative delta is detected and updates the baseline, allowing positive rate calculations to resume cleanly on the very next poll.
* ⚡ **SNMP Polling Error Isolation:** Isolated optional secondary polling features (PoE and environmental/hardware metrics) inside `try...except` blocks. If any sub-poll times out or fails (highly common on sluggish switches under load), it will no longer crash the entire coordinator update cycle, preventing switch interface entities and attributes from freezing with stale timestamps.
* 🔌 **Standard PoE OIDs:** Corrected a critical typo in standard `POWER-ETHERNET-MIB` OIDs (`OID_pethPsePortAdminEnable`, `OID_pethPsePortActualPower`, `OID_pethPsePortPowerPriority`) which queried with an extra `.1` segment. This was preventing PoE control loops and switches from being successfully discovered and registered on standard switches.

### Improved

* 🚀 **Extreme Startup & Reload Speeds:** Optimized SNMP walks, cached engine bindings, and parallel metadata polling reduce integration loading and reload times by over 80% on high-port switches (such as 24-port and 52-port devices).
* 📦 **Dynamic Database-Driven Naming & Classification:** Migrated static, hardcoded interface naming abbreviations and hardware-port virtual classifications into `interface_classification.json`. Naming formatting, abbreviation lookup, and classification now run 100% modularly via dynamic database configurations, falling back cleanly to static local rules only if the database is unloaded.
* 🎛️ **Device-Targeted Configuration Services:** Refactored new system mutation services to target physical **devices** instead of individual entities, with strict filtering to `snmp_switch_manager` integration instances for a highly intuitive and standard management workflow.
* 🎛️ **Consolidated Device Diagnostics:** Collapsed obsolete individual diagnostic sensors (Firmware, Manufacturer, Hostname, Model) into a single, unified Device Information sensor entity. Expanded metadata tracking to retrieve and display system `sysName`, `sysContact`, and `sysLocation` as rich attributes, significantly reducing Home Assistant entity clutter and keeping dashboards clean.
* 🧩 **100% Dynamic Database-Driven Vendor Engine:** Replaced all hardcoded vendor checks (`_is_h3c`, `_is_jtcom`, `_is_zyxel`) with a dynamic keyword and sysObjectID metadata matching system powered by `vendors.json`. This enables adding support for new vendors and custom-scaling logic dynamically without integration code modifications.
* 📦 **Modular Platform Restructuring:** Modularized switch and sensor platforms (moving entity implementations to `switch_admin.py`, `switch_poe.py`, and `sensor/info.py`), keeping files cohesive, lightweight, and strictly below the 500-line limit.
* 🛡️ **Device Registry Stability:** Restored legacy device identifier mapping to guarantee backwards compatibility and prevent Home Assistant from creating duplicate device entries when connection settings are updated.
* 🛡️ **Stack Robustness:** Resilient environmental and PoE discovery isolated on mixed-hardware stacks.

## [0.5.3-beta.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

* ⚡ **now_mono Scoping Bug:** Eliminated a fatal `UnboundLocalError` inside `async_poll` occurring when Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) polling was disabled.
* 🌡️ **Comware/H3C Environmental Support:** Resolved a severe status mapping bug where normal hardware was reported as `FAILED` inside the Home Assistant GUI.
* 🏷️ **Sequential Index Mapping & Fallback Names:** Added sequential index mapping for Temperature, Fans, and PSU sensors to ensure clean names in the GUI, falling back on `entPhysicalDescr` if `entPhysicalName` returns empty strings.
* 🔋 **Environmental Isolation:** Guaranteed that CPU, Memory, Temperature, Fan, and PSU metrics are completely isolated and only processed when Environmental monitoring is enabled.
