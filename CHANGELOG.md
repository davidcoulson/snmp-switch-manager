---

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-23
### Added
- 🎚️ Support for Mikrotik RouterOS
- ⚡ Port Speed in the interface attributes
- 🏷️ VLAN ID in the interface attributes (PVID / untagged VLAN)
- 🧩 Per-device custom SNMP OID overrides for diagnostic sensors (with reset to defaults)
- 🏷️ Updated README

### Fixed
- 🚧 Thanks to [@cerebrate](https://github.com/cerebrate) for Cisco SG-Series interface filtering improvements
- 🚧 Diagnostic sensors now refresh correctly without requiring an integration restart
- 🚧 Corrected Manufacturer and Firmware OIDs for Zyxel devices

---

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-24
### Added
- 🧰 **Device Options** panel replacing Custom SNMP OIDs
  - Per-device overrides for SNMP community, port, and friendly name
- 🧩 **Per-device interface include rules**
  - Starts with / Contains / Ends with matching
  - Can explicitly include interfaces otherwise excluded by vendor logic
- 🚫 **Per-device interface exclude rules**
  - Prevent entity creation and remove existing matching entities
  - Exclude rules always take precedence
- 🧭 **Multi-step rule manager UI**
  - Clean, menu-driven Options flow
  - Dedicated sub-forms for include rules, exclude rules, and custom diagnostic OIDs
- 🏷️ **VLAN ID (PVID) attribute reliability improvements**
  - Added fallback handling for devices that index PVIDs by `ifIndex`

---

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-25
### Added
- ⏱️ **Configurable Uptime polling interval**
  - Default uptime refresh reduced to **5 minutes** to avoid excessive updates
- 🧰 **Stabilized Device Options framework**
  - Confirmed persistence and correct reload behavior for all option changes
  - Options now reliably apply without requiring multiple manual reloads
- 🏷️ **Port Name Rules**
  - Regex-based renaming verified working end-to-end
  - Fixed rule application order and duplicate-prefix issues (e.g. `GigEgE`)

### Improved
- 🧩 **Interface Include / Exclude rule engine**
  - Rule changes now correctly:
    - Apply immediately
    - Persist across restarts
    - Remove or restore entities as expected
  - Exclude rules properly remove existing entities (not just block creation)
- 🔄 **Integration reload behavior**
  - Reduced reload time on large switches
  - Eliminated spurious “Unknown error” during option changes

### Fixed
- 🚧 Uptime sensor updating too frequently
- 🚧 Option removal not persisting after UI close or reload
- 🚧 Device Options menus not applying changes properly

### Removed
- 🗑️ **Friendly Name override**
  - Removed from Add Entry flow and Device Options
  - Entity naming now relies solely on device hostname and interface name

---

## [0.3.5] - 2025-12-25
### Fixed
- 🚧 Custom Diagnostic OIDs not applying properly

---

## [0.3.6] - 2025-12-26
### Added
- 📶 **Bandwidth Sensors (RX / TX throughput & total traffic)**
  - Optional per-device bandwidth sensors
  - RX/TX rate sensors (bits per second)
  - Total RX/TX byte counters
  - Per-device enable / disable
  - Per-device polling interval
  - Independent include and exclude rules
- 🧰 **Bandwidth Sensor rule engine**
  - Include rules: Starts with / Contains / Ends with
  - Exclude rules always take precedence
  - Rules apply immediately and persist across restarts
  - Bandwidth rules are fully isolated from Interface Include / Exclude rules
- 🧭 **Expanded Device Options menu**
  - Dedicated Bandwidth Sensors sub-menu
  - Independent configuration from interface discovery rules

### Improved
- 🔄 Device Options flow stability
  - All option dialogs now return cleanly to the parent menu

### Fixed
- 🚧 Bandwidth polling interval validation and persistence
- 🚧 Incorrect interface speed on some devices that report in bps
